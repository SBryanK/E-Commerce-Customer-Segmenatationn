This report delineates the application of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methodologies to 
analyze datasets for predictive and exploratory purposes, respectively. Utilizing a sales dataset from 
Walmart, the report embarks on regression and classification analyses under the supervised learning 
paradigm. Concurrently, an online retail dataset facilitates the exploration of clustering analysis through 
unsupervised learning, addressing distinct challenges inherent to each approach.
